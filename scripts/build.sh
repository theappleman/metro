  PLEASE NOTE:
  ============

  As of Metro 1.3.0, the metro command itself can perform all the
  functionality of this script.

  You can perform the same actions as the command above by calling
  Metro as follows:

  $mycmd

  The build will continue in 10 seconds...

EOF
sleep 10
$mycmd
exit $?
